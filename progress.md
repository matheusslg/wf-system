- Updated standards.md with project-specific conventions
- Generated 3 agents:
  - `wf-system-commands` - For command development
  - `wf-system-hooks` - For Python hooks and installer
  - `wf-system-reviewer` - For code review (read-only)
- Generated 5 skills:
  - `gh-pr` - Create GitHub PRs
  - `gh-issues` - List/manage GitHub issues
  - `py-check` - Check Python syntax
  - `cmd-list` - List all commands
  - `sync-commands` - Sync commands to global install

## Session Archive

> When this file exceeds 500 lines, move older sessions to `.claude/session-archive/sessions-{N}-{M}.md`
> Keep only the last 5 sessions in this file for AI readability.

## In Progress
- None

## Next Session Should
- [ ] Test hooks in a fresh session to confirm visible feedback
- [ ] Create GitHub issues for planned features/improvements
- [ ] Run `/wf-pick-issue` to start development

## Decisions Made
- Tech stack: Shell (Bash), Python, Markdown, Git/GitHub
- Scopes: commands, hooks, docs
- Three agents: commands (development), hooks (development), reviewer (read-only)
- Hook output uses `systemMessage` for visible user feedback (not just `additionalContext`)

## Notes
- This is the wf-system repository - the workflow management tool itself
- Commands are in commands/*.md, hooks in hooks/*.py
- Hook installed at ~/.claude/hooks/wf-orchestrator.py
